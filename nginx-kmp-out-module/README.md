# Nginx KMP Output Module

A utility module for outputting KMP tracks.

Used by: [nginx-rtmp-kmp-module](../nginx-rtmp-kmp-module/), [nginx-mpegts-kmp-module](../nginx-mpegts-kmp-module/), [nginx-kmp-cc-module](../nginx-kmp-cc-module/).

Dependencies: [nginx-common](../nginx-common/).


## Features

- Support for dynamic destinations, via the `publish` HTTP request
- Notification on input end / upstream error (`unpublish` HTTP request)
- Support for publishing a single track to multiple upstreams (replication)
- Reconnect on upstream error, via the `republish` HTTP request
- Configurable resume offset - in case of `republish`, can start sending frames from one of the following offsets -
    - The frame after the last frame that was explicitly acked
    - The frame after the last frame was sent successfully (can be used with upstreams that do not support sending KMP acks)
- Memory usage enforcement
- Protection against upstreams that do not return acks in a timely manner - free buffers when the memory usage percent exceeds a configured value
- Management API


## Control messages

### Publish

#### Sample request (RTMP publishing)

```json
{
    "event_type": "publish",
    "input_id": "rtmp://testserver:1935/live?arg=value/streamname_1/video",
    "input_type": "rtmp",
    "rtmp": {
        "app": "live",
        "flashver": "FMLE/3.0 (compatible; FMSc/1.0)",
        "swf_url": "rtmp://testserver:1935/live?arg=value",
        "tc_url": "rtmp://testserver:1935/live?arg=value",
        "page_url": "",
        "addr": "5.6.7.8",
        "connection": 983,
        "name": "streamname_1",
        "type": "live",
        "args": "videoKeyframeFrequency=5&totalDatarate=200",
    },
    "media_info": {
        "media_type": "video",
        "bitrate": 82000,
        "codec_id": 7,
        "extra_data": "0164000bffe100196764000bacd942847e5c0440000003004000000783c50a658001000468efbcb0",
        "width": 160,
        "height": 120,
        "frame_rate": 15.00
    }
}
```

**Note:** the exact structure may change depending on which module uses nginx-kmp-out-module.
For example, when used with nginx-mpegts-kmp-module, the `rtmp` block is replaced with an `mpegts` block, and contains different fields.

#### Sample response

```json
{
    "code": "ok",
    "channel_id": "somechannel",
    "track_id": "sometrack",
    "upstreams": [{
        "url": "kmp://127.0.0.1:6543"
    }]
}
```

#### Response fields

- `code` - required, string, the status code of the publish request, if set to a value other than `ok`, the publish request is retried.
- `message` - optional, string, the error message, printed to log when `code` is not set to `ok`.
- `channel_id` - required, string, the channel id sent on the KMP connect packet
- `track_id` - required, string, the track id sent on the KMP connect packet
- `upstreams` - required, array of objects, each object can contain the following fields:
    - `url` - required, string, must include ip address and port (hostname is not supported), can optionally be prefixed with `kmp://`
    - `id` - optional, string, used for identifying the upstream in `republish` requests and in the management API
    - `required` - optional, boolean, when set to `true`, an error in the upstream frees the output track, and the input connection associated with it.
        When set to `false`, an error in the upstream is ignored, unless the upstream is the last upstream on the output track.
        The default value is `true`.
    - `resume_from` - optional, string, sets the offset from which the module starts sending frames, if the upstream connection is re-established.
        The following values are defined:
        - `last_acked` - the frame after the last frame that was explicitly acked (this is the default)
        - `last_sent` - the frame after the last frame that was successfully sent
        - `last_written` - the frame after the last frame that was written to the output buffer
    - `connect_data` - optional, string, base64 encoded, sent as the data of the KMP connect packet

    "reason": "rtmp_close"
}
```

The `reason` field in the request can have the following values:
* `alloc_failed` - memory limit reached / out of memory

## Configuration Directives

### kmp_out_api
* **syntax**: `kmp_out_api [write=on];`
* **default**: `none`
* **context**: `location`

Enables the API interface of this module in the surrounding location block. Access to this location should be limited.

The optional `write` parameter determines whether the API is read-only or read-write. By default, the API is read-only.
